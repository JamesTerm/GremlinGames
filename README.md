SVN migration: source for the Fringe and Rim Space, as well as legacy simulated robot code for BroncBotz and Curivator

This project started back in 2007 by Rick, Justin (art designer), and myself (James), unfortunately back in 2011 the repository had to get migrated, and when this happened the SVN history was lost for those 5 years.  Also 2011 was a transition for some of the code technology which started the robot code base, which later became the robot simulation code.  Shortly after this a new SVN repository was created for the robot code (that gets deployed on the robot), while this respository maintained a virtual copy for the simulation.  

Included in this repository is a video demo of the Fringe Game:  ./Fringe/The Fringe - Magic Carpet Ride.wmv

Rim Space, is the next revision of the game mostly in the art work.  While we have good working demo's of the game, we had a performance problem using OpenSceneGraph (OSG), with the machines we had at the time, and retired the project shortly afterwards in 2011.  Not included in this repository is RimBlade, where Rick was able to complete and ship this game for the Android. (I'm trying to end this readme on a happy note).  In reflection of this project, it opened the doors for students in the FIRST community as it planted seeds about some of the concepts offered in this source passed down from one mentor to the next.
