<p><font size="+3">Which Faction is Right for You? - Personality Test </font></p>
<p>When the full Fringe MMORPG launches, there will be different factions for you to join. 
  Each faction has a different playing strategy and each has different strengths 
  and weaknesses. The factions are distinct and make for 
  a very dynamic universe. Even in &quot;The Fringe - Alpha Team,&quot; the various factions will be represented by distinctive ship designs.We have the factions grouped, roughly, by personality 
  types, so take the test and see which factions needs your skills.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FFCC00" size="4">The Official &quot;Which Faction is Right for You?&quot; Personality 
  Test</font></strong><br>
  Choose which of these personality types best suits you, then find out 
which faction you should join. </p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">A. </font>You drive a fully loaded Hum-V with 
  the super mean, chrome plated brush guard in the front, and large mean tires underneath. 
  Diplomacy is for sissies. You have a shotgun in one hand and a bazooka in the 
  other. That should be enough to settle any argument!</strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#FCA503">B. </font>You drive a silver BMW with bulletproof 
  windows. You can find your way anywhere, with the car's GPS navigation system. 
  No one realizes you have a pistol in your suit coat and a high power sniper 
  rifle with night-vision scope in the trunk.</strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#0080FF">C.</font> You work hard. You've invested a large 
  chunk of your life in a finely tuned, race ready Subaru STI. You know every bolt 
  inside and out. It has a full roll cage and stripped interior (who needs all 
  that weight anyway). Your home was taken by THE MAN and now you have a box of 
  grenades and you&#8217;re ready to pay a visit.</strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">D.</font> All you have is $10 in your pocket. 
  You borrow the old Camero from the guy with the Subaru (neglect to return 
  it); steal the shotgun from the guy with the Hummer when he goes to the bathroom (has a nice picture of his girlfriend in his wallet); then sneak up on the guy 
  with the BMW and rob him at gunpoint.</strong></p>
<p><font color="#FEC501"><strong>Choose the one that best matches you, and look below for your faction!</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000"><img src="Titles and Logos/UnionPlain.gif" width="111" height="93">A. 
  The Union: &#8220;Strength In Unity&#8221;</font></strong></p>
<p><em>The Union established the original foothold in the Fringe. Set up as a 
  colony by the Republic, the Union grew quickly due to the discovery that the core 
  systems were rich in natural resources. Soon the Union was strong enough to 
  wage war against the Republic, and won its independence. (Although, more and more 
  it seems the Union receives support from the Republic now and again.) In time, the Union became almost as overbearing as the Republic. They established a 
  militant society that was powerful, but ignored the need for exploration and 
  the analytical or artistic parts of their growing society.</em></p>
<p><br>
  The Union people are the original settlers of these territories. They are a 
  proud and powerful group and seek to expand the borders and acquire resources 
  for the greater good of the Union. The highly organized Union Navy is the chain 
  of command and also serves as the government body. With promotion comes honor and leadership. 
  No man's vote is counted unless he serves in the Union Navy. They have nearly 
  limitless resources and unquenchable desire for new territory.</p>
<p>Union 
  ships are large, well equipped, heavily armed, and protected by a thick armored hide. The proud 
  Union Navy usually launch full faced into combat situations and are well designed 
  to do so. It has long been  regarded to be poor military tactic to meet 
  the Union in face-to-face combat.</p>
<p>The Union Navy does not stomach defeat very well. Thankfully, they rarely need 
  to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FEBF01"><br>
  <img src="Titles and Logos/FedPlain.gif" width="134" height="93"> B. 
  The Federation: &#8220;Discovery, Honor, Enlightenment&#8221;</font></strong></p>
<p><em>The Federation movement was formed by scientists and explorers who worked 
  in secret and eventually established an independent colony in some of the outer 
  sectors of space. Weakened somewhat by this maneuver, the Union took on a more 
  Imperialistic attitude and started infringing upon neutral settlements that 
  were originally given by the Republic to independent settlers. By-and-large, 
  these territories were undefended. Some Union leaders spoke out about these 
  dishonorable actions. These leaders were banished, stripped of rank, and had 
  their homes taken. They united and formed the &#8220;Black Militia&#8221; and 
  were surprisingly successful, acquiring several prime systems across the border 
of Union space.</em></p>
<p> The Federation used their technological advantage to settle what was, at that 
  time, distant space. The Federation people are good-natured explorers at heart 
  and would choose to avoid combat, if possible. However, when backed into a corner, 
  they prove to be most impressive in tactical situations. The Federation seeks to expand 
  its borders to gain resources and security, but often chooses uninhabited space 
  and new star systems, rather than militant takeovers. They deal quite harshly 
  with anyone threatening their borders. They are honor bound to uphold their 
  commitments to others.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Federation vessels are well equipped and often have several 
  sets of redundant systems to protect from system failures in combat. Federation 
  ships are usually protected by shields, and are well engineered for stealth. 
  They only bear weapons, which are often hidden, when needed. Federation vessels 
  typically have the largest sensor range of any space going vessels and can typically 
  strike from a greater range than most other ships. Their preferred form of victory 
  comes in completely disarming an opponent and forcing a surrender, which of course is the 
  most dishonorable and humiliating defeat imaginable to a Union commander.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0080FF"><img src="Titles and Logos/ColonialPlainLight.gif" width="169" height="113">C.</font> 
  <font color="#0080FF">Colonials: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Tread on Me&#8221;</font></strong><br>
  Colonials are ship builders. They take great pride in the performance of their 
  craft. Colonials are masters of hit and fade combat, sabotage, demolitions, and 
  anything else referred to as &quot;dirty tactics.&quot; They are at constant 
  odds with the Union (although it seems that the Union is at constant odds with 
  everyone), but don't spare the Federation the occasional scuffle as well. Colonials 
  are defenders of the weak or out-gunned and are seldom known to back down from 
  a fight, even if the odds are against them - as they often are. They have been 
  known to assist the Federation in one fight,  then steal resources from a Federation 
  system the same day. </p>
<p>Colonial vessels are engineered for speed. It is both the primary defense and 
  the offensive strike tactic. There is no room in Colonial vessels for backup systems, 
  shields or heavy armor. Elegantly simple designs outmaneuver most enemy fire. While Colonial vessels have surprisingly effective firepower, Colonial pilots that 
  sit still long enough are easily defeated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font color="#008000"><img src="Titles and Logos/IndiPlain.gif" width="135" height="185">D.</font> <font color="#008000">Neutrals: &#8220;Are 
  you gonna&#8217; eat that?&#8221;</font></strong><br>
  Neutral parties come here to escape big government; some of them even have legitimate 
  reasons. These people commonly say things like, &#8220;I ain't payin&#8217; no taxes,&#8221; or, &#8220;Love 
  is a warm gun.&quot; They live for the day, and love their freedom. For the most part, these people are underfunded and band together in groups, 
  for protection and opportunity. As Smugglers, Pirates, and Bounty hunters, Neutral 
  parties are opportunistic, resourceful and highly adaptive, with a mismatch of <em>borrowed </em>ships and equipment from the 3 other political factions. Some Pirate clans 
  have become so powerful that it takes military force to hold them at bay. It 
  is nearly impossible to track them down because of the sheer vastness of unclaimed/undesired 
  space. Pirates hit their targets, take what they want, and simply disappear.</p>
