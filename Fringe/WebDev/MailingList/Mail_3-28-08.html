                <p>Many of you may have seen the UGLY HUD I built for Justin last week.  This is an example of what I would affectionately call &quot;programmer art.&quot;  Justin had given me a picture of things that we were not able to do yet, so, as a programmer, I was obliged to implement something that was functional, yet as hideously ugly as possible -- to spur Justin into getting me a more realistic snapshot, so, there you have it, programmer art.  He got back to me with this.  It's still not really everything we want it to be (HUD functionality is not a feature I had planned on having up and running right away, but Justin begged and pleaded for SOMETHING to see while &quot;test flying&quot;).</p>
              <p>Sound effects are working very well now with the help of FMOD.  It is cool to hear the Doppler Effect as you fly by things in space.  WE can also play music in the background.  The goal is to allow you to listen to your own play lists or, by default, listen to the soundtrack that comes with the game.<br>
                    <br>
                We are in the process of hooking up a bug database and Wiki discussion group using FOGBUGZ for those that are interested in helping with early beta testing.  It has some really excellent features that will keep us in tight communication with the people that matter most to us:  YOU!</p></td>

              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The <strong>Union Vexhall AF-4</strong> (originally slated as the &quot;Ruger-Vexhall&quot;)</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Our original game concept was less faction based and more industry based. Each ship was manufactured by a competing company and one of the leading companies was &quot;Ruger.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img src="../media/Newsletter/3-28-08/Vexhall_old.jpg" width="349" height="121"> </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Ruger was a company that specialized in producing heavy arms. The Vexhall was a heavy fighter designed to deliver a substantial blow to larger, slower vessels. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The game concept has been much improved, along with the ship designs.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Vexhall AF-4 is a powerhouse fighter. It boasts two medium cannons, suitable for destroying gun emplacements, communications, and other large ship based components. It is also armed with a high velocity Gatling gun for lightly armored targets, and carries 30 mini-missiles for dealing with other fighters. In addition, the Vexhall is equipped with a reasonably powerful sensor array that makes it useful as a scout. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">T</font><font color="#FFFFFF">win, vertically  mounted engines provide the Vexhall with a good amount of thrust, and maximize the ability to dive or climb, although the weight of the armored hull does give the fighter a sluggish response to controls. The Vexhall is designed with large targets in mind and relies on missiles and armor to fend off enemy fighters rather than high G force &quot;dog fighting&quot; abilities.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Overall, the Vexhall is a great work of engineering. It is a definite threat to support vessels (such as frigates and cruisers). The thick hide protects it from  onslaughts and allows the fighter to deliver heavy firepower on command. The versatile hull can carry even more fire power than described here, with  a few minor modifications. The systems are durable and easily repaired in flight. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Union Navy enjoys having ample firepower wrapped in thick armor, and they have it all in the Vexhall AF-4! </font></p>
