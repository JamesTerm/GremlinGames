
9/13/2012 Major revamp on how the ship controls work with the cruise control where the requested velocity is now a Vec2d.  Also fixed speed to show linear and angular velocities from encoders (if over-ridden).  Also added new joystick curve to replace isSquared to better control the curve of input

9/14/2012 Show 3 different drives for the followgod test

9/15/2012 
Major bugfix to how Nona deals with centripetal forces... where now circle strafes, and sharp fast turns work properly. 
Fixed autonomous for all drives by applying a strafe scaler in the DriveToLocation
Fixed dHeading by adding inverse skid scaler (added mathlib in lua to support math functions)

9/23/2012
Significant 80ms latency eliminated by using the force with voltage (use the force James) :)
Finally sorted out the heading rates as they were incorrectly too high
Fixed swerve drive by eliminating the condition to bypass swivel (since the close-loop is so well tuned)
Added tank steering support
All drives now of control support in lua, and you can switch between robots with different controls
	-As proof of concept the butterfly drive uses tank steering

9/26/2012
Added traction mode using the R1 and R2 buttons... the wheels will turn red when you are in traction mode
and the kicker wheel and rotation are disabled.  Also fixed bug in gear reduction simulated encoders now
the robot will travel at its real top speed (so it will be faster than it was before).

This should be feature complete! (for the drive that is)

9/27/2012
Fixed some bugs with the PID settings working in both modes, butterfly also now using correct control
The inv_max_force is re-tuned now that the gear ratios are correct in the encoder simulation

Added POV turning
