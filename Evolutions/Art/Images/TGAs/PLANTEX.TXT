Plantec's Texture Tiles
thenar@cinenet.net

Hi gang, Plantex is my first texture collection.  I hope you can use them. The names are only vaguely
accurate.   They work great in TS for making planets, surfaces etc.   By applying metalic sheen and
using the same texture as a bump map you can get some interesting texture effects.  Rufmetal is intersting 
if you use it as a bump map and as a texture map and then use an environment picture over that with 
metal gloss on.   Mess around with the phong and specular settings.  try droppin out the texture map
and using yellow to make rough gold.  
	I'm building  more as we speak.
