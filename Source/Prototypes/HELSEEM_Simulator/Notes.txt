Workspace Setup
===============
The base code for the HELSEEM_Simulator is is used for 2 different applications, the ZEUS_Simulator 
and the ATL_Simulator.  Bot projects are in the same folder, but are seperate vcproj files.  
They may share the same resource files, but they will have special implementations of functions
that are specific to their needs.  I will try to keep the code base as common as possible.


Implementation Tasks
====================
- (Depends on time) 
	- Allow driving over the terrain
