A comment starts anywhere with a double hyphen (--) and runs until the end of the line. Lua also offers block comments, which start with --[[ and run until the corresponding ]]. A common trick, when we want to comment out a piece of code, is to write the following: 

    --[[
    print(10)         -- no action (comment)
    --]]

Now, if we add a single hyphen to the first line, the code is in again: 
    ---[[
    print(10)         --> 10
    --]]
