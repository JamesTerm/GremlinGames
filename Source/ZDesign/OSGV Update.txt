/*!	\page  OSGV_Update_txt	OSGV Update

There are some things we need to do with OSGV to make it play better with what
we are going to be doing with the Fringe clients.  

\section sec_ClearOutSingletons	Clear Out Singletons
There are quite a few Singleton patterns used in OSGV.  Some of them might be valid, but 
we know that some of them, like the EventMap, are not.  We have to have seperate EventMaps
for each ship.  I removed the Singletons and renamed GG_Framework::UI::SceneManager to
GG_Framework::UI::ActorScene and made sure there was not a global one of those (we will
eventually have the BoundingBox one as well).

\section sec_RemoveScrubbing	Remove Scrubbing
Scrubbing was a feature in OSGV from the beginning, but no one ever used it, and it does some
things with time and makes some couplings that we do not want.  That has been removed.

\section sec_Timer	Timer
The global EventMap used to have the timer, but we broke that out into the Timer class
and made it handle its own ticks.  I have considered making it do the framerate as well.

\section sec_NoAA	Turning off Anti-Aliasing
I added GG_Framework::Base::IArgumentParser an had an argument -na that turns off anti-aliasing.
