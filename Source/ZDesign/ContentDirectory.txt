/*!	\page ContentDirectory_txt ActorActions: Fixed Content Directory - Bug

When working with LWO & LWS files, all external references are relative to the
Content Directory.  In revs 37&38 (4/16), Rick made the LWO amd LWS readers look up the directory 
chain in order to find the ContentDirectory.  He also changed the way the parent directory
was found when setting the CWD.  This seemed to cause a crash when reading TestShot.osgv.

James had provided somewhat of a band-aid patch in rev. 48 that essentially skipped this code,
but this fix handles it at a lower level. 

@section Test Regression Test
HighLevelRegression_Tester.LoadTestShot1 just loads the testShot.osgv file and crashes.

@section Analysis
The CWD_Wrapper c'tor sets the CWD with osgDB::getFilePath().c_str(), but that yields a garbage
value.  Storing the std::string in a local variable fixes it.
