For now we are using particle effects for smoke trails and such.  There are two problems we are seeing:
one is that when the trail runs out of time, it all dissapears rather than fading away.  When the trail
is supposed to stop, the trail that is already there should not just go away, it should just stop creating particles.

I was able to get this working by not killing the effect right away, but rather setting the start time to some time in the future.

The second problem is that eventually all of the particles go away.  There seems to be a maximum particle limit, then
they are all gone.  This happens when we have the emmitter that just continues.  Its like all of the emmiters are turned
off at once, then they do not get turned back on because we are using a WHILE effect.

I found out how to set the emmitter duration.

Finally Justin wanted to be able to set the length of particle trails. I did this by setting the particle duration.
