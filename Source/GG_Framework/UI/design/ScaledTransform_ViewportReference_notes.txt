/*! \page ScaledTransform_ViewportReference_note ActorActions: Using ViewportReference with a Scaled Transform - Notes

I can see how setting the ViewportReference of the Camera to an actor that is inside a 
ScaledTransform would screw things up.  I am cheating the size of things in ScaledTransforms, 
making things seem much larger than they really are, by bringing the object closer to the 
camera, and making sure it draws behind other objects in the scene.  In order to make sure 
the camera does not fly THROUGH the planet that is (REALLY only 2 km in diameter and 100 m 
away for example), I have to move that object along with the camera.  In a sense, the object 
is sort of parented (to the position only, not the rotation) of the camera. 
 
So you can see the problem.  When you set the ViewportReference of the camera to an object 
in a ScaledTransform, the camera is parented to the object which is parented to the camera.  
WHEE!  Nodes that are in a ScaledTransform are meant to be window dressing in the 
scene.  They are only there to look good.  When I actually do work with planets (gravity, 
collisions, etc) I will need to maintain their ACTUAL position and size in double precision 
without relying on the perceived position in the visual scene graph.  It is working correctly, 
and it is working the only way it could work (that I can think of) to maintain the feature 
of having planet sized objects in the scene.  Most space games do not do this at all.  The 
planet is a part of the background image.  I think it is cool that we have it. :)
