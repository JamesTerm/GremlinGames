World3a.jpg is a replacement for world3.tif. There has been some problem with the
latest. It looks like by reorganising avalon there was made mistake and a corrupt
version was placed. This file is a JPG  exported from Photoshop with quality set at
high. If someone wants the uncompressed version feel free to contact me.
