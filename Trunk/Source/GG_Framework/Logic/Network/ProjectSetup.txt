/** \page FrameWork_RakNet_ProjectSetup_Tour FrameWork.RakNet Project Setup Code Tour

FrameWork::RakNet is built as a pretty minimal wrapper on the RakNet library.
We are basically just providing somne simple wrapper interfaces and implementations 
based RakNet.  We want to create a simple reusable Client and Server interface
that focusses on the interface we are interested in.  We also want to create a
mock version of these interfaces for use in a single player game or automated test.  I 
decided that it was useful to do this for a single player game so that the code base
for a single-player demo would be exactly the same as that for a multi-player
game.  

The mock interface just would cause the packets to not actually be sent, so that someone 
playing the single-player demo (or us running automated tests) would not be bothered by 
the firewall.

The other thing I want to provide in this library is the class FrameWork::RakNet::EventManager,
which does some work parsing the in-coming packets and provides very specific events based on
the content of the incoming packets.  You should be able to subscribe to events for a specific
player, packet type, particular network object (like a ship), etc.  (I am going to wait 
and do that in another iteration, as I need it).

Another thing this library has is the FrameWork.RakNet.PacketEnumerations.h file that 
has packet enumerations specific to our needs.  Specific games may have their own packet
enumerations on top of these.
