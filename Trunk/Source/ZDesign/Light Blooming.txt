We want to make it so we can see light flares from engines and explosions farther in the distance.  We can use a scaling factor like
we do for planet scaling so we scale the objects in the distance.

\section Light_Blooming_FuncSpec Specification
'U' lines are for light blooms.  You specify a nominal distance and a far distance.  When the camera is closer
to the object than the nominal distance, no scaling is performed.  When the camera is between the nominal
distance and the far distance, the object is scaled so that its apparent size on the screen is the same as at the
nominal distance.  Beyond the far distance, the object will scale down as normal.  For instance, if the nominal distance
is 10 meters and the far distance is 1,000 meters, and the camera is 300 meters away, the object will be scaled to 
30x its original size.

\section Light_Blooming_Design Design
- I added the LightBloomTransform class along with similar related classes in CameraParentedTransforms.h.
- ActorScene::ReadSceneGroup reads in the 'U' from the file and parses the nomDist and farDist and creates the node

I am applying a test change in:
