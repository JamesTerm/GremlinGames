/*!	\page  Logo_Scene_txt	Logo Scene

Fringe.Single and Fringe.Client will run a logo scene in a separate thread while the game 
is loading.  We will not worry about any kind of status window at this point.  We can just 
print the status and messages to the console.  We will just have a viewer that looks at an 
OSGV scene.  We do not even need a trackball around it.  This means that there needs to be 
a way for the designer to specify the viewer distance and background colors.  
We will also use OpenThreads so that this scene can play on a different thread.

I have found that you cannot play an OSG window in a thread different from the one that
created it, which means we will just make all of the OSG windows in the main thread,
and have everything else be threads.  To make this work, I just made a simple
OpenThreads::Thread in the main client that determines what should be takes to another thread.

As for the background colors and the viewer distance, we will wait off until the Designer
wants to do more with the Logo.
