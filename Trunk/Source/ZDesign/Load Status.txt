/*!	\page  Load_Status_txt	Load Status

We need a way to have the game provide some meaningful feedback to the user as the game is loading.  To start with,
for the VIP Demo, this feedback will be displayed on the console, but we can eventually have a bar display on
some kind of loading screen.

We want to have an idea of the amount of time a particular LUA script takes to load.  The script can provide a
sequence of predicted times for the various stages of loading (perhaps after each model or file is loaded).

We should write out the times in a way that is easy to copy and paste back into the LUA scripts.

- Create a static GG_Framework::UI::LoadStatus class with thread safe operations for a tick() that gets called from everywhere
	
- To start with, this interface JUST writes the times to a file that can easily be copy/pasted in place in a LUA script

- Paste the times in a LUA Script

- Be able to read the times from a LUA script (may not be there)

- Transfer the times through the network (or some default saying they were not there)

- The Load Status indicator uses this information to compare times and fire and event that has remaining time, etc.

- The console windows listen to the event and printf a string to tthe console
