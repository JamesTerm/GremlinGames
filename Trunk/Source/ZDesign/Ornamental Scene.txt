/*!	\page  Task01_OrnamentalScene_Page	The Ornamental Scene

Set up a basic scene, full of all Ornamental Items (no need for Entity3D).  This will 
essentially be like OSGV, except that the scene is going to be defined in a GameScript 
(just passing in OSGV files).  Start with the initial spinning logo scene and make the 
switch.  We need to make sure we get all of the networking connected and passing the 
information.  There will not be any more messages passed after the scene is created and 
showing.  The CameraManipulator should be a simple Trackball Manipulator around one of the 
objects.  We should be able to log in as multiple clients, over a network, and all see the 
same scene.

@section Task01_DesignNotes	Design Notes
- Stub out the Server all the way through, but skip the creating the AI part
	- Do not create an AI item, make sure the AI does not have a Server/Client pair and 
		that the ServerManager can handle it for now.
	- Place Comments for where the AI should be read
	- Make sure the Server is waiting for Client connections, then reading the LUA script 
		for ornamentals (perhaps 2) and passing them to the connected client first
- Stub out the Player reading through everything

@section Task01_Tasks Tasks
* Make sure ServerMaster can handle not having 2 Servers
- Work through the Server to wait for clients to connect
- Create the Client all the way through connection
- Make sure we are getting messages passed across and printing out the correct message
- Make the Client have the temporary scene, small window until game launches

- Look at LUA examples again, Build the LUA
