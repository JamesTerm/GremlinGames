New Project Process.txt
=======================
To add a new DLL project to the solution:

1.  Add the new DLL with App Wizard at the proper position as a DLL exporting some symbols
2.  Rename the project to include namespaces eg. GG_Framework.UI
	a.	Remove the project from the sln
	b.	Rename the .vcproj file in Windows Explorer
	c.	Open the .vcproj file with notepad, replacing the name of the project and the defined export preprocessor macro and default namespace
	d.  Add the project back into the solution
3.	Rename the main header file
	a.	Remove the main header file from the project eg. "LUA.h"
	b.	Rename it in windows explorer eg. "FrameWork.LUA.h"
	c.	Add the file back into the project
	d.	Change the name of the included file in LUA.cpp
	e.  Change the control macros to have FRAMEWORK_ or whatever
4.	Clean out code examples
	a.	MAYBE Remove DllMain
	b.	MAYBE Remove windows includes from stdafx.h (VS 9 has the version info header, you may not need that if not dealing with windows)
	c.	Remove or comment out exported symbols, 
		1.	Remove comments from the main header file to make it look like others
		2.	Replace LUA_EXPORTS with FRAMEWORK_LUA_EXPORTS
		3.	Replace LUA_API with FRAMEWORK_LUA_API
	d.  If making an EXE project, use the program start that other exe's are using that provide version 
		information (see the examples from existing EXE projects main() )
5.	Change project settings
	a.	General Output Directory
	b.	C/C++ / General / Additional Include Directories: $(GG_ADDN_INCLUDES)
	c.	Linker / General / Additional Library Directories: $(GG_ADDN_LIBS_RELEASE) | $(GG_ADDN_LIBS_DEBUG)
6.	Add external dependencies
	a.  Add any required external deps to the Utilities folder
	b.	SVN add the deps in the Utilities folder
	c.	Make sure "debug_bin\_SDKUpdate.bat" and "release_bin\_SDKUpdate.bat" copies binaries
		in to the debug_bin and release_bin folders.
	d.	Run "stable_bin\_SDKUpdate.bat" to make sure they are copied to the stable_bin folder
		from "release_bin".
	e.  SNV add them in the stable_bin folder
7.	Add Items to SVN
	a.	Remove ReadMe.txt
	b.	Add the remaining items (not Debug or Release folders if compiled)
	c.  Make a release build to the release bin
	d.  If an EXE (and not a tester), add it to "stable_bin\_SDKUpdate.bat" to make sure 
		it copies over the new files to stable_bin.
	e.  Run "stable_bin\_SDKUpdate.bat" and SNV add the new copied binaries in the stable_bin folder

Whenever you add a new project or add a dependency to a project, update the DoxyMain.txt file
to include it it the dependency tree.  It is best to use a namespace for your project (even
if it is a test or exe) so that there can be a nice namespace for DOxygen as well.
