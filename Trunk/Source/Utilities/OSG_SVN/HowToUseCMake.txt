At this time use Cmake version 2.4.8!
Install
gg/Tools/cmake-2.4.8-win32-x86.exe

Run 

1. Drag the Source\Utilities\OSG_SVN\OpenSceneGraph\CMakeLists.txt onto main window
2. Change where to build binaries to something like Source/Utilities/OSG_SVN/Visual_Studio_9_2008_Win32
3. Hit configure pick your platform compiler (e.g. VS 2008) 
4  Change some of the settings like so:
	CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = ....Source/Utilities/OSG_SVN/Visual_Studio_9_2008_Win32/INSTALL
	EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH =  ...Source/Utilities/OSG_SVN/Visual_Studio_9_2008_Win32/bin
5.  Check the Show Advanced Values
6.  OSG_MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL = off
7.  OSG_MULTIMONITOR_MULTITHREAD_WIN32_NVIDIA_WORKAROUND = ON  (as some of my machines are crashing)
-----------Note: turn off all floats as this will enable ships to fly farther away without jitters!--------------------
8.  OSG_USE_FLOAT_BOUNDINGBOX = off (TODO ensure performance is still good)
9.  OSG_USE_FLOAT_BOUNDINGSPHERE = off (same here)  The same for the rest of the OSG_USE_FLOAT_*
10.  Click Configure again
11.  All the boxes should be grey (you may need to "trick" the mfc one by turning on and off) if not address the red boxes
    and click configure again
12.  The Ok button should be enabled... click to generate the project files and solution




In regards to Vs 9.0 I have included highlight90.reg which was found here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/osg-submissions@lists.openscenegraph.org/msg00683.html
As well as the other versions of visual studio.  This is a must to read header files!

Highlist90.reg has been included to this folder and can be launched for VS 9.0 to display the header files properly.

createHighlightRegFiles.pl
You'll need to install perl
ActivePerl-5.10.0.1003-MSWin32-x86-285500.msi

The script should be executed from the VisualStudio directory, as it writes
output files to the current directory, though that can be changed. It takes the
base directory of the includes as an argument (../include) and an optional "-p"
or "--print" argument which will cause it to print the directory and file names
as it traverses.

I've made a .bat file which will launch it automatically and update the .reg files... it will do it for each platform, so I delete the ones
we do not use.
