Description:
Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform C++/OpenGL library that is focused on Camera control. 
Producer's Camera provides projection ยน, field of view, viewpoint control, and frame control. Further, 
Producer can be used in a multi-tasking environment to allow multiple Camera's to run in parallel supporting 
hardware configurations with multiple display subsystems. Threading, Camera synchronization and frame rate 
control are simplified in the Producer programming interface.
