This DOxygen set describes all of the Fringe and GG_Framework projects.  Here are the different
Phases we are building, with some of their details.

\section sec_Phase1		Phase 1
Only Player Flying, Multiple Players, No Physics, No Collisions, No Weapons or Explosions,
LWS driven "AI" (Just ornamental).  No messages passed for Ornamental stuff.

Flow:
	- Start at position/orientation, Cruising speed.
	- Animated Camera, No Player Control, Defined by a LWS then control goes to chase plane
	- Text Display like a HELP screen (C++ Control, Show Justin How)
	- Mouse Controlled Turning, natural Banking to push pilot into seat at the ships best
	- Chase Cam, natural range and pitch angle and (LOTS of Notes, not writing yet)
	- All AI are non-entities!!!  All LWS! 
	
Features:
	- Variable Max Speed (m/s), Cruising Speed (% of Max Speed), Max Acceleration (m/s2)
		"Natural Brake" (m/s2) to revert to cruising speed, Brake Decceleration (m/s2)
		Afterburn Max speed (m/s) & Acceleration (m/s2) & Max Burn (s), Slows to cruising speed when off
		Keybinding control to cruising speed (needs text).
	- Allow designer to set Camera FOV as a function of ship's controller
	- Post Draw Callbacks broken away from OSGV standard so Justin can add them
	- Help Screen with Current Keybindings
	- Controller objects allow camera to be manipulated with a LWS scene, cut back to control
	- Controller objects allow for a *slush* meaning a maximum amount of compensatition
	- More fancy keybindings, Ctr+Alt+ double click, Function Keys, Arrows

	When the player connects, after loading, ask the script file for a ship and initial
	Position/Attitude.  Pop that in for existing players as well.  Part of connecting
	is getting the list of the other player ships in the scene.  We also need an epoch
	time so all of the LWS files are playing at the same point across the clients.
	Trackball control around YOUR ship.
	
	
	\subsecion subsec_Phase1B	\ref Phase_1B_page
	
	Be able to move the ship with some controls (KB/Mouse) and let the other clients
	see the motion by passing the positions.  Interpolate velocities for frames.
	Snap adjustments (perhaps half adjustments). Trackball Control around YOUR ship.
	Provide more complex key bindings.  Use a SIMPLE controller class and Show the 
	keybindings in the help window.  Still a Trackball around your ship's position (ViewPortReference).
	Allow for keybindings to fire Events ONLY on your ship, but other clients see it.
	
	
	\subsecion subsec_Phase1C	\ref Phase_1C_page
	
	Provide the real Flight Control and Camera Motion View Manipulators. 
	
	
	
\section sec_Phase2		Phase 2
Collision Detection and explosions with AI driven by the LWS still.  Actors are in 
the LWS scene and can interract (explode) and are removed from the scene.
We should also be able to launch from a specific ship.  No Physics.  We need to pass mesages
for the LWS (ornamental scenes) so they can fire OSGV actions and explode (ONLY).
Animated Camera (defined by LWS), then goes to Chase Plane View.  Launch from Ship.
