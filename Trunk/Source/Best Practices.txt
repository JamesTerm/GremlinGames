/** \page BestPractices	Best Practices

This page is dedicated to tracking items that could be considered as best practices by the group.  I am not 
sure these will be considered as coding standards, or even that perhaps we should have one of these for each person.
I want to try to avoid just writing things because they sounded like a good idea from someone else, but just include
things in here that have actually helped us individually.  

For the most part, I want to include items in here that are based on experiences we have had debugging.  After
working through a sticky problem, ask yourself the question:  "What could I have done to make this a lot easier 
to debug, and/or make it so I would not have had the problem at all?" 

Hopefuly, just writing it down will keep the rule in our heads, but we may need to review it occasionally.  We might
also want to eventually have some code review or make it more of a standard for new programmers.


\section Rules Rules
- If you find a bug that was either due to a scripting and content error, OR was due to some issue not directly
	tied to the code wheree the error was resolved, and there was not indication in the user output of the error,
	once you find the problem, add an ASSERT_MSG or some other indicator that would show the problem in the output.
	It would be good to test with the error still in place to make sure the error comes up properly.
	
- If you override a virtual function, always call __super:: rather than naming the base class explicitly.  Also,
	when overriding a virtual function, be sure to always call the __super:: version, or at least provide a note
	as to why you didn't.
