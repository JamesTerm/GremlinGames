#  Q33-A  LANCE-EAGLE
#
# The Q33-A LanceEagle is a high velocity variable wing space superiority fighter.
# It is the 3rd generation fighter in the high performance Q seris engineered by the Colonial Malicia.
# The Q33 follows the proud tradition of the QX19 Hunter and the Q22 Lightening in building superior 
# performance low cost fighters. Like all other fighters in the seris it uses variable wings to adjust 
#the center of gravity and adjust control planes to maximize flight control.
#
# The Q33-A marks a huge leap in Colonial engineering. The Q33 is the first Colonial fighter to be 
# servicable in both space and atmosheric flight. The hull is smoother and the frame is much lighter 
# than previouse designs allowing for incredible acceleration. The frame is also more rigid and durable 
# thanks to it's multi point cellular design. More weight is reduced by doing away with the gyroscopic 
# cockpit module and as in the last "Q" fighter, there is no room in the Q33 for the added weight of landing gear.
# The HUD, onboard computer and, Gravity dampening systems are all greatly enhanced and this is the first Colonial fighter to allow for the assistance of a COG to 
# do on the fly repairs and handel minor ship functions. The Q33 also houses the new line of high thrust engines developed by the Colonials. These engines offer 
# different levels of thrust to improve perfomance and efficency. Magnetic thrust vectoring shoots out a wide burst of particles at low speeds to allow for a 
# greater "grip" for quicker acceleration, and at high speed a narrow thrust band of super high speed particles to allow for a much higher top end velocity.
#
# All these improvements aside the Q33 is still a very short range fighter. It has a small fuel capacity compared with fighters built by the Union and the Federation. 
# Wile the engines are more effecient than previouse Colonial engines, no fuel saving sacrifices were made that would reduce engine performance.
# While the Q33 is surprisingly rugged it still does not offer ray sheilds and has only limited armor plating. Communications systems are fragile and there are 
# no auxilary systems to backup primary ship systems.
