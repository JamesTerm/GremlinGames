                <p>We have made huge improvements in the game engine! I'm happy  to say that we have nearly completed our VIP demo!! The VIP demo is not  designed for public release. It is used to help us find the needed revenue to  complete The Fringe. </p>
              <p>The completion of the VIP demo does mean that we are closing in  on the release of our initial installment. I'm pleased to announce that &ldquo;Team Alpha&rdquo;  now has a new official name: &ldquo;Miramar  Station.&quot; This title truly reflects the nature of the first installment. We are  working to make Miramar Station much like the Top Gun training course.  Development is well underway to create the training facility and the  surrounding systems. Look for more information and video in future newsletters.</p>
              <p>Vapor trails!! Yeah, I know that in space you may not have vapor  trails, but at high speed in nebulous space you very well may! The trails make  it easy to see where you are and give you a better feel of distance and position  in space&hellip; and they look pretty dang cool, too! At the moment, they still need a little  work. They do not yet have the look we are going for. Fighters will generate  trails on acceleration or hard maneuvers. </p>
              <p>We have had quite the call to &ldquo;Blow Stuff Up!!&quot; lately. </p>
              <p>Well, we are  several steps closer. Bounding boxes have been created that allow ships to fly  close to other ships and to know when they collide. Collision detection allows  ships to calculate damage from bullets and missiles. This means objects can be  hit and track events such as explosions and bullet hits, and soon we will be able to &ldquo;BLOW  'EM UP!&rdquo; WAHAHAHAHA!</p>

                <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>By: Justin, Art Director</strong></font></p>
              <p>Q33-A&nbsp; LANCE-EAGLE:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;The Q33-A Lance-Eagle  is a high velocity, variable wing space, superiority fighter.<br>
                It is the 3rd generation fighter in the high performance, low cost Q series  engineered by the Colonial Militia; following in the proud tradition of the QX19 Hunter,<br>
                <font color="#FFFFFF"><img src="../media/Newsletter/4-22-08/Q-19.jpg" width="400" height="160"> </font>and  the Q22 Lightening.</p>
              <p><img src="../media/Newsletter/4-22-08/Q-23.jpg" width="400" height="160"></p>
              <p>Like all other  fighters in the series, it uses variable wings and control planes to adjust the center of gravity,   thus maximizing flight control and maneuverability.</p>
              <p>The Q33-A marks a  huge leap in Colonial engineering. The Q33 is the first Colonial fighter to be serviceable  in both <strong>space</strong> and <strong>atmospheric flight</strong>.<br>
                &nbsp;The hull is smoother  and the frame is much lighter than previous designs, allowing for incredible acceleration.  The frame is also more rigid and durable, thanks to its  multi-point cellular  design. Weight has also been reduced by doing away with the gyroscopic cockpit module. There is no room in  the cramped Q33 for landing gear, shields, or heavy armor. It is a superior dogfighter and relies on speed and maneuverability to dodge enemy fire. </p>
              <p>Onboard firepower is specifically designed to make short work of enemy fighters. The Q33 uses four Vulcan cannons as its primary armament. The usual missile load out is five small warheads housed in an internal magazine. The Q33 can also be outfitted to carry four medium warheads for ship assaults as well.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;The HUD, onboard  computer, and gravity dampening systems are all greatly enhanced. This is  the first Colonial fighter to allow for the assistance of a COG to  do &quot;on the fly&quot; repairs  and handle minor ship functions. (However, this feature is  limited.)</p>
              <p>The Q33 also houses the new line of high  thrust engines developed by the Colonials. These engines offer different levels of  thrust to improve performance and efficiency. Magnetic thrust vectoring shoots  out a wide burst of particles at low speeds to allow for a <br>
                &nbsp;greater &quot;grip&quot;  and quicker acceleration.  At high speeds, a narrow thrust stream of super high  speed particles shoots out to allow for a much higher, top end velocity.</p>
              <p>All these  improvements aside, the Q33 is still a very short range fighter. It has a small  fuel capacity compared with fighters built by the Union  and the Federation.  &nbsp;While the engines are  more efficient than previous Colonial engines, no fuel saving sacrifices were  made that would reduce engine performance.</p>
              <p>The Q33 is  surprisingly rugged, yet it still does not offer ray shields and has only limited  armor plating. Communications systems are fragile and there are&nbsp;no auxiliary systems  to backup primary ship systems.</p>
              <p>The Lance-Eagle is a dedicated fighter killer, and only pilots who are willing and able to fly by the seat of their pants should attempt to pilot it. </p>
